Installation Instructions:

Unzip this file into your HOME directory. It'll put everything in a folder called xerafin.

If you have a Zyzzyva Cardbox (version 2.2.3 or older, only), put your Anagrams.db file in the xerafin directory.

At the command prompt, type 

cd xerafin

to get into the xerafin directory, and then

./install.sh

to run the install script.

Karatasi and Zyzzyva syncing are optional. 
The assumption is that your Karatasi library directory is located at $HOME/Library/Karatasi and
your Zyzzyva is the default under $HOME/Dropbox/Apps

Note Zyzzyva syncing will be deprecated when the new NASPA-authored version is released.
